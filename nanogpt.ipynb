Unicode characters are the standard way to represent all possible human languages plus our favorite emojis 😀😙 in byte streams. There are multiple Unicode standards: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, etc. However, because unicode characters are not very memory efficient, this basically means that we need to start with a **huge** base dictionary size to begin with our tokenizer. And this is why the authors of GPT-2 chose to instead use a byte-level BPE tokenizer. That is, we split characters into futher smaller fragments (1 byte, or 8-bits) and use those as our base dictionary. This way, we can reduce the base dictionary size from 100,000+ unicode characters to just 256.\n",

In most traditional tokenizers, if a word is not in the vocabulary, it is treated as an unknown word and assigned a special token, often <UNK>. This results in a loss of information about the unknown word, making it challenging for the model to predict or generate the correct word during the inference process.\n",
        "\n",
        "BPE, on the other hand, alleviates this problem by breaking down words into subword units. It starts by tokenizing the text at the character level and then iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of characters or character sequences to create subwords. This process continues until a predefined vocabulary size is reached or no more merges are possible. The resulting vocabulary consists of a mix of whole words, subword units, and individual characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "When BPE encounters an unknown word, it can break it down into its subword units, which are likely present in the vocabulary. This allows the model to better understand and represent the unknown word, even if it has not seen the exact word during training. By preserving information about the unknown word's structure, BPE enables more accurate predictions and text generation, as the model can leverage the subword information to infer the correct word or generate similar words."

        "\n",
        "Great job on implementing Part 1! In Part 2, we will implement the transformer layer. The first step in building the transformer layer is multi-head attention. Let's understand how attention works. The motivation behind attention is that some parts of our input data are more important than others. We only want to focus on the important parts of the data. The attention mechanism achieves this by using a set of queries, keys, and values generated from the input tokens. A similarity score is produced between a query $q_i$ and a key $k_j$ and higher similiarity scores means token $i$ should attend to token $j$ more. \n",
        "\n",
        "GPT-2 is an auto-regressive model (i.e. it predicts future tokens given previous data). GPT-2 uses masked attention because we want to mask the information about future tokens. If we had information about future tokens, this would be considered cheating because the model would know what to output. GPT-2 uses multi-headed attention, or multiple attention heads. Using multiple heads is useful because it enables the model to attend to parts of the sequence differently. You can think of it as enabling more expressivity in communication amongst tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we implement multi-headed attention head in the following steps:\n",
        "1. Generate queries, keys, and values from the input tokens (computed in the previous part)\n",
        "2. Use the queries, keys, and values to compute masked attention\n",
        "3. Apply a linear projection and dropout to the masked attention\n",

        "\n",
        "**Note:** The input `x` is of size `(batch_size, seq_len, d_model)` and the output is of size `(batch_size, tgt_len, d_model)`. However, the attention function should take in queries of size `(batch_size, n_heads, tgt_len, d_head)` and keys and values of size `(batch_size, n_heads, seq_len, d_head)`. Thus, we need to rearrange the input and attention output somehow to match the different dimensions. Also note that for self-attention, `tgt_len == seq_len` since we are passing the input `x` as the queries, keys, and values.\n",

        "2. How does GPT-2 compare with other state-of-the-art models, such as BERT, RoBERTa, or T5, in terms of performance on various NLP benchmarks?\n",
        "3. How can GPT-2 be fine-tuned or adapted for specific tasks or domains, such as medical text generation, code generation, or creative writing?\n",
        "4. Why does gpt-2 architecture needs to have masked attention?\n",
        "5. What are the ethical considerations and potential biases present in GPT-2 due to its training on large-scale web data? How can these biases be mitigated or addressed?"

        ">SOLUTION\n",
        "1. The model size (number of parameters) has a significant impact on the quality of generated text and the ability to learn different tasks in a zero-shot setting. Larger models generally perform better on various NLP tasks, as they have more capacity to learn complex patterns and dependencies in the data. However, they may also require more computational resources and memory during training and inference.\n",
        "2. GPT-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on several NLP benchmarks, but its performance compared to other models like BERT, RoBERTa, or T5 may vary depending on the task. For instance, BERT and RoBERTa may perform better on tasks that require bidirectional context, while GPT-2 excels in generative tasks.\n",
        "3. GPT-2 can be fine-tuned or adapted for specific tasks or domains by training it on task-specific or domain-specific data. This process involves updating the model's weights using a smaller learning rate and a smaller dataset that is relevant to the target task or domain.\n",
        "4. GPT-2 architecture needs masked attention to enforce its autoregressive nature, ensuring that the model predicts tokens based only on the information available up to the current position in the sequence. This helps the model to generate coherent text and learn context-dependent relationships between tokens.\n",
        "5. Ethical considerations and potential biases in GPT-2 arise from its training on large-scale web data, which may contain biased or offensive content. These biases can be mitigated by using techniques like data filtering, bias-aware training, or fine-tuning on carefully curated datasets that minimize bias."
