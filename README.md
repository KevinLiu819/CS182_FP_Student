# CS182 FP

Our final project for CS182 Spring 2023 is to create a NanoGPT HW Problem Set. This final project includes **ONLY** the Jupyter notebook full of instructions and tutorials for students to complete the problem set. This repo does not contain Jupyter notebook solutions and hidden autograder tests because it is used for distributing the homework to students.

This repo contains:
- nanogpt.ipnyb: Jupyter notebook for students
- data: Dataset file
- grader: Sanity checks for students
